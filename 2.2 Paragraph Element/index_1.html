A self-closing tag in [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), also known as a void element, is a type of tag that does not require a closing tag. This is because these elements do not contain any content that would go between opening and closing tags. They are used to insert something into the document in a standalone manner.

Here are some examples of self-closing tags in HTML:

- `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">` for images.
- `<br>` for a line break.
- `<hr>` for a horizontal rule.
- `<input type="text" name="username">` for input fields.
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` for linking CSS files.
- `<meta charset="utf-8">` for specifying character set.

These tags are typically used to embed or insert elements directly into the HTML document without the need for an enclosing tag. In [XHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and XML, self-closing tags are explicitly closed using a slash before the closing angle bracket (e.g., `<br />`), but in HTML5, it is sufficient to use just the opening tag without a slash.
